rules:

if surrounding tiles total > 3.2 the tile gains .2
if surrounding tiles total > 1.6 the tile gains .1
if the tile > .5 surrounding tiles that are unlived (-1) have a 3/4 chance to be set to .5
if surrounding tiles total > 6.4 the tile loses .2
if a tile = 1 it loses .1 and and all surrounding tiles lose .1
